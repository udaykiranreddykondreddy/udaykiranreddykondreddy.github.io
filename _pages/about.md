I'm working as a Technical Intern (Machine Learning) at **synopsys** And also as a Research Associate at **MUST Research Academy**, my work is Creating course content, demo projects and helping students in their Capstone Projects.

Prior to that I did my internship at **Smatsocial**, moslty worked on python and related technologies to get data from different social platforms and recommend them to the clients.

I did my Bachelors degree in Computer science and engineering at K L University in 2018.

I have broadly worked on machine learning and started exploring Natural language processing and Computer vision.

I always learn by sharing, which made me to start an online community of Machine learning enthusiasts on Instagram [**@learn.machinelearning**](https://instagram.com/learn.machinelearning) with over 84,000 members.
