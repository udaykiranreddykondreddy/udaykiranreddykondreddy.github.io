### About


<img src="/assets/images/logo.png" width="250" height="250">

I believe one thing is sharing by learning. I learned a lot from the community and this is the time I should give it back. So I started a community to share my knowledge regarding machine learning and related domains. This community has around 250000+ ML enthusiasts who are willing to learn. Because of this community, I'm learned a lot and shared a lot.

You can find my community on Linkedin, Instagram, Telegram, Youtube
